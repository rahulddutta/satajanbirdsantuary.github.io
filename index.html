          <h2 class="sata">Satajan Wetland</h2>
          <p class="satainfo">
            Although, water bodies such as Deepor Beel and Maguri Beel are well
            known for hosting birds, there are also smaller patches of wetlands
            which do not meet the international criteria of being a Ramsar Site
            or an Important Birding Area (IBA), but are equally important for
            the ecosystem as well as the communities residing alongside. One
            such example of a water body is Satajaan, a wetland situated in the
            North-Lakhimpur district of Assam. It is at a distance of
            approximately 8 km from the Lakhimpur township. The infamous wetland
            situated adjacent to the Pahumara-Kimin state highway and National
            Highway 15 is one of the last surviving wetlands of the region
            hosting enormous bird species every year. Being aside the river
            Ranganadi, the wetland with marshes and dense fringing vegetation
            receives fresh water recharge every monsoon. According to a research
            work published in December 2019 by Department of Botany, Rajiv
            Gandhi University, Arunachal Pradesh, there are 262 species of
            vascular plants on the wetland. <br />
            <br />
            The wetland hordes the bird species from the onset of October till
            their return by the end of March or early April, enjoying the
            landscape which supports the roosting and breeding of birds. Some of
            the local non-migratory water birds such as White breasted Waterhen,
            Bronze-winged Jacana, Eurasian Moorehen, Grey-headed Swamphen and
            many others can be found here perennially. The migratory birds such
            as Gadwall which flies across different demographic conditions to
            reach the flood plains of Assam every year, too finds its shelter in
            this wetland. The local migratory waterfowls such as
            Lesser-whistling Duck, Fulvous-whistling Duck, Indian Spotbill Duck
            etc., get dispersed post-winter during their breeding season. In
            addition to the aforementioned water birds, Satajaan also
            accommodates local and migratory terrestrial and bush birds like
            Coucals, variety of Warblers, Starlings, Wagtails, Pipits etc. It
            was indeed astonishing to notice the density of birds in a
            relatively smaller area (39 acres).

          <p class="satainfo">
            When the changing climate is already showing its impact on the
            ecosystem globally, the health of this wetland have been further
            challenged by several anthropogenic activities.The locals says that
            one of the primary reasons for the degradation of the wetland is
            yearly winter picnic accompanied by littering of plastic wastes,
            noise from loud speakers and clearing bushes for fire which was
            evident as we reached the site. Unfortunately, the time of the year
            also coincides with the arrival of migratory birds and human
            activities such as picnics disturb the natural state of avifauna.
            The wetland which is claimed to have got created by the devastating
            earthquake of 1950, has also observed the disturbances caused by
            sand mining along the river Ranganadi during the non-monsoon season.
            It is the same river which is already under pressure due to the
            upstream water infrastructure projects and has observed reduced
            hydrological flow. Presence of non-insulated high-tension wires
            around the wetland have added to the threats of lives of these
            flying birds and frequent cases of electrocution of birds are
            observed. This survey was the first-ever effort by the Department of
            Forest, Government of Assam to understand the diversity of avifauna
            residing on the water body.
