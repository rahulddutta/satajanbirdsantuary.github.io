            <h2 class="sata">Satajaan Wetland</h2>
            <p class="satainfo">
              Although, water bodies such as Deepor Beel and Maguri Beel are
              well known for hosting birds, there are also smaller patches of
              wetlands which do not meet the international criteria of being a
              Ramsar Site or an Important Birding Area (IBA), but are equally
              important for the ecosystem as well as the communities residing
              alongside. One such example of a water body is Satajaan, a wetland
              situated in the North-Lakhimpur district of Assam. It is at a
              distance of approximately 8 km from the Lakhimpur township. The
              infamous wetland situated adjacent to the Pahumara-Kimin state
              highway and National Highway 15 is one of the last surviving
              wetlands of the region hosting enormous bird species every year.
              Being aside the river Ranganadi, the wetland with marshes and
              dense fringing vegetation receives fresh water recharge every
              monsoon. According to a research work published in December 2019
              by Department of Botany, Rajiv Gandhi University, Arunachal
              Pradesh, there are 262 species of vascular plants on the wetland.
              <br />
              <br />
              The wetland hordes the bird species from the onset of October till
              their return by the end of March or early April, enjoying the
              landscape which supports the roosting and breeding of birds. Some
              of the local non-migratory water birds such as White breasted
              Waterhen, Bronze-winged Jacana, Eurasian Moorehen, Grey-headed
              Swamphen and many others can be found here perennially. The
              migratory birds such as Gadwall which flies across different
              demographic conditions to reach the flood plains of Assam every
              year, too finds its shelter in this wetland. The local migratory
              waterfowls such as Lesser-whistling Duck, Fulvous-whistling Duck,
              Indian Spotbill Duck etc., get dispersed post-winter during their
              breeding season. In addition to the aforementioned water birds,
              Satajaan also accommodates local and migratory terrestrial and
              bush birds like Coucals, variety of Warblers, Starlings, Wagtails,
              Pipits etc. It was indeed astonishing to notice the density of
              birds in a relatively smaller area (39 acres).
            </p>
            <h1 class="sata">Point at Issue</h1>
            <p class="satainfo">
              When the changing climate is already showing its impact on the
              ecosystem globally, the health of this wetland have been further
              challenged by several anthropogenic activities.The locals says
              that one of the primary reasons for the degradation of the wetland
              is yearly winter picnic accompanied by littering of plastic
              wastes, noise from loud speakers and clearing bushes for fire.
              Unfortunately, the time of the year also coincides with the
              arrival of migratory birds and human activities such as picnics
              disturb the natural state of avifauna. The wetland which is
              claimed to have got created by the devastating earthquake of 1950,
              has also observed the disturbances caused by sand mining along the
              river Ranganadi during the non-monsoon season. It is the same
              river which is already under pressure due to the upstream water
              infrastructure projects and has observed reduced hydrological
              flow. Presence of non-insulated high-tension wires around the
              wetland have added to the threats of lives of these flying birds
              and frequent cases of electrocution of birds are observed.
            </p>
            <h2 class="sata">Tone down</h2>
            <p class="satainfo">
              There should be frequent documentation of the birds which will
              provide the temporal diversity of avifauna in the wetland. The
              birders can also upload their sightings to eBird.org (a citizen
              science based online inventory to report bird and their count in a
              given area) to make the data accessible to public.
              Interdisciplinary researches must be conducted to understand this
              wetland from technical as well as social perspective. Along with
              the birds, there could also be a decent diversity of Herpetofauna
              and a documentation can be carried out, the results of which might
              interest researchers across the globe and demand conservation of
              this wetland from a policy level. If Satajaan wetland is not
              scientifically managed following the Wetlands (Conservation and
              Management) Rules, 2017 (updated on 2020) by Ministry of
              Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, there
              is always a chance that the wetland will lose its charisma as well
              as importance of being resourceful. Intervention from the
              Government will also be utmost important to prohibit any kind of
              disturbances to the wetland through human activities, especially
              when winter is here and picnic plans are on its way. However, the
              efforts led need not be limited to Satajaan or any one wetland.
              Each swamp has its own importance and must be protected to the
              level best.

              <b>Baliram Gogoi</b> is a busy man. The 78-year-old wakes up
              around 4.30 am despite the cold, takes a stick and his mobile
              phone, and makes a round of Satajan, a 270-bigha wetland on the
              banks of the Ranganadi here, checking if any poacher had got
              closer to trap a bird. “Satajan is not only home to so many
              species of birds but is also a destination for several migratory
              species,” said Baliram, a farmer who was earlier associated with
              the district unit of the Village Defence Organisation, a body
              formed during the Chinese aggression of 1962 to help villagers.
              Baliram knows most of the species by their local and English
              names. “It is difficult to remember the scientific names, so I
              have bought several books to refer to whenever I need to find out
              or tell visitors about the different birds,” he said. Bird species
              that have been listed here include common teal, purple moorhen,
              lesser adjutant stork, gadwall, lesser whistling teal, night
              heron, ferruginous duck, darter or snake-bird, and spotted bill
              among others. Sadly, he is no more with us and his work is being
              carried out by his son
              <b>Mr. Lakhidhar Gogoi</b>
